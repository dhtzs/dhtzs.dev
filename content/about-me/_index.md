## Introduction
Greetings! I'm Dimitris, a self-motivated fourth-year student currently immersed in Digital Systems at the University of Thessaly. My academic journey has not only honed my programming skills but has also fueled a deep-seated passion for ethical hacking and problem-solving.

As an avid bug bounty hunter, I bring a distinctive blend of knowledge, imagination, and hands-on experience to the realm of cybersecurity. Actively engaging with top bug bounty platforms, I collaborate with diverse organizations to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, contributing significantly to enhancing their security posture.

__This journey is more than a pursuit; it's a true passion that I approach with enthusiasm and dedication__. Beyond my academic endeavors and bug bounty exploits, I am committed to continuous learning. In my spare time, I delve into relevant books, articles, and online courses, applying newfound knowledge to tackle hacking challenges. This perpetual learning cycle not only enhances my skills but also deepens my understanding of the dynamic field of cybersecurity.

## Experience and Contributions
I've had the privilege of engaging with top bug bounty platforms, collaborating with diverse organizations to uncover vulnerabilities and bolster their security posture. In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, I prioritize a methodical and data-driven approach. My methodology encompasses a blend of manual testing, automated scanning, and targeted research to identify vulnerabilities. I'm continually exploring new tools and techniques to refine my process, with a specific focus on reconnaissance. My goal is to stay at the forefront of evolving attack vectors and exploitation techniques.
