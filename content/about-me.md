I am a self-motivated student currently in my fourth year of Digital Systems at the University of Thessaly.

As a programmer with an interest in ethical hacking, I am drawn to the challenge of solving problems and the field of cybersecurity.

As a bug bounty hunter, I am skilled at using my knowledge, imagination and experience to come up with creative solutions to complex problems. This allows me to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems and networks, ultimately making them more secure.

In my spare time, I strive to expand my knowledge and expertise by reading relevant books and articles or participating in online courses. Applying this knowledge to tackle hacking challenges allows me to enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of the subject.

I am eager to continue learning and exploring this exciting area as I pursue my professional goals.
